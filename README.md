# Cover Generator
A Simple Figma Plugin to make File Covers using User Inputs.

# How it works?
It does the following
- Ask for user to enter Name and Description
- Creates a new Page
- Append a frame into it
- Append the 2 user input text as text node into it
- make the newly created page as the current page

# Roadmap
- Still working on it.
